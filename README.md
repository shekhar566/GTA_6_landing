## 🎮 GTA VI Motion Experience Website

A cinematic scroll-motion website inspired by Rockstar’s GTA VI announcement style — built to explore animation-first interactions, scroll-triggered storytelling, and synchronized media playback.

---

## 🧠 Why I Built This

I didn’t want to create a typical static UI — I wanted something that **moves**, feels **cinematic**, and reacts to scrolling the way game reveal trailers unfold.

This project challenged me to explore:

- Motion-driven UX  
- Scroll-based animation timing  
- Smooth parallax depth  
- Balancing visuals and performance  
- GSAP timeline sequencing and optimization  

---

## 🎬 Key Motion Features

- 🎥 **Scroll-synchronized video playback**
- 🧲 **Pinned motion sections**
- 🌫 **Multi-layer parallax scrolling**
- ⚡ **Lazy-loaded media for smooth performance**
- 🎨 **Neon cyber-cinematic visual theme**

---

## 📚 What I Learned

- ScrollTrigger requires planning — not random easing  
- Animation performance impacts perceived UX  
- Mobile breakpoints need unique motion logic  
- Parallax + synchronized playback feels cinematic when balanced
